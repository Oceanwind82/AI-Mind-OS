Narrow AI (Weak AI)\n- Designed for specific tasks\n- Examples: Siri, Netflix recommendations, spam filters\n- **This is what we use today**\n\n## 2. General AI (Strong AI)\n- Human-level intelligence across all domains\n- Can understand, learn, and apply knowledge like humans\n- **Still theoretical - doesn't exist yet**\n\n## 3. Super AI\n- Exceeds human intelligence in all aspects\n- **Pure science fiction for now**\n\n### Real-World Examples:\n- 🎬 **Netflix**: Recommends shows you'll love\n- 🚗 **Tesla**: Self-driving capabilities\n- 📱 **Your Phone**: Voice recognition and predictive text"
